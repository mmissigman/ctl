Your client may still qualify for counsel if the court determines that your client is indigent based on the extent of their inability to pay. In determining whether a person is indigent, the court will consider: income, property owned, outstanding obligations, the number and ages of their dependents, and the cost of bail. GOTO:5

Q(5): If your client is found to be indigent, they may also be eligible to waive their Civil Court fees, as defined in Idaho Code ยง 31-3220. Your client must submit an affidavit stating that they are indigent and are unable to pay fees, costs or give security. The affidavit must also contain: the person's identity, the nature and amount of income, spouse's income (if applicable), real and personal property owned, cash or checking account, dependents, debts, monthly expenses, nature of the action, and your client's belief that he is entitled to compensation.
